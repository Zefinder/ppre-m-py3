# Project Pokemon ROM Editor Modernized Enhanced

## Introduction
This is a complete overhaul of the [PPRE project](https://github.com/projectpokemon/PPRE) and a direct fork of [PPRE-M](https://github.com/nia-e/ppre-m), that fixed a few bugs that I won't have to fix (he he). All credits go to Alpha and the Pokemon Project team, since they have developped it since quite some time (2012 according to PPRE first commit). 

## Installation (TODO)
You will need **Python3** to use this project. Once Python3 is installed, (TODO add what will happen here, issue #6)

## Description
Some history (taken from the original README). PPRE is a multi-purpose ROM editing tool for altering Nintendo DS Pokemon games. The project was started originally to edit Pokemon Diamond and Pearl by SCV based off of Treeki's Nitro Explorer and loadingNOW's thenewpoketext. pichu2000 created a strong basis for the scripting capabilities that PPRE will always have. Alpha has added many new features to make PPRE as versatile as it is. PPRE is written in Python and makes use of PyQt for its GUI. Development was led by SCV and Alpha.

Now it is time to improve it even more using PyQt6 and Python3. The point of this project is to understand an old project and update it with nowadays tools (and maybe add important features). Also this is more or less adapted to US versions, it's time to adapt it to EU version!
